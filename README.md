## Classification of museum-related tweets in New York City

The aim of the project is to explore a relationship between location and a use of language in microblog data, specifically, Twitter data. Twitter data is open and it is also possible to query it based on location. One of important tasks is to identify and predict tweets with "semantically meaningful locations" (Lee et al., 2014), or points-of-interest locations, such as, for example, museums in New York City. The work presented in this paper aims to answer two questions: to which degree a text of a given tweet is related to an actual physical location of that tweet (whether there is a distance dependency), and what features could be used to predict or classify a tweet as related to a museum (as a topic/location). Two classification experiments are performed using differently balanced data. Several classifiersâ€™ performance is compared based on two feature models (a set of word co-occurrences and a dictionary of museum names, abbreviations and tags).

Thank you to Dr. Chodorow for advice and help with the conceptualization of the project, suggestions for data collection and the experiment as part of an independent study. Thank you to Dr. Filatova for all the advice and help with conceptualization, classification methodologies and techniques, paper formatting and finalizing this experiment during the class of Text Mining. Thank you to Dr. Rozovskaya for advice and suggestions on using WordNet or similar semantic/synonym sets for a feature model and sharing useful techniques and model reporting during Methods in Computational Linguistics II class.
